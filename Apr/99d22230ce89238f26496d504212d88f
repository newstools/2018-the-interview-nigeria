Though young people often outgrow their passion and love for games, it is not so in Abiola Olaniran’s case who has become a multiple award winning software developer. Abiola started out early in life, developing his first game code at age 15. Long before many saw the promising future of gaming, Abiola pursued his dream to be software/game developer upon graduation from the Computer Science and Mathematics department at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Winning the Microsoft Imagine Cup software competition in 2010 gave Abiola the opportunity to join the team that represented Nigeria at the world finals in Warsaw, Poland. From wining the Samsung Nigeria Developer Challenge (Games and Edutainment Category) in the same year to founding Gamsole with 88mph’s seed fund in 2012, Abiola’s story is one of breaking new grounds and unraveling opportunities therein. Today, he is Nigeria’s highest paid Windows Game developer and a software developer.  His Gamsole got over three million downloads worldwide just within six months of its launching on the Windows Phone Store. In 2016 he was named on Forbes listed as one of Africa’s most promising entrepreneurs, and also won The Future Awards Africa (TFAA) Prize for Technology.
